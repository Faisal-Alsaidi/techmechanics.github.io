This is a website I created for a computer engineering project which displays a fake computer company, offering a custom built gaming PC and multiple computer repair services. As I still don't really know how to create responsive websites, I would recommend running the website on a computer or tablet as the larger aspect ratio will actually allow the website to look like a website. The actual website is located [here](https://techmechanics.github.io).
